DESTROY_ONLY_DESCRIPTION_TEXT=This will destroy only the infrastructure (i.e servers, databases, networks) related to this stack. \
            It will not delete the stack definition.
DELETE_ONLY_DESCRIPTION_TEXT=This will delete the definition of the stack only. You will not be able to create new \
                             instances (plans) but any existing stack instances will not be destroyed. \
                             If you delete a stack without destroying all current instances, then you will be \
                             responsible for cleaning up those resources manually and this might tie up resource quota.
DELETE_ALL_DESCRIPTION_TEXT=This deletes everything related to this stack.  Both the definition and any instances will \
                            be destroyed. This will free up any deployed resources and erase the creation information \
                            (variables and app stack plan).
DELETE_BUTTON_TOOLTIP=Destroy or delete your stack
